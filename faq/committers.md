# Committers' FAQ

## Project Websites

### Can I use Google Analytics?

The Apache Software Foundation discourages the use of Google Analytics.

You can only use Google Analytics if:

 - the user's IP address would be anonymized before transmitting data
 - the user approved the use of Google Analytics before it was loaded

Court decisions around Google Analytics have changed several times
in the past years and made its use uncertain.

### Can I use Google Fonts?

You can use Google Fonts, but please host the fonts on ASF servers.

ASF projects don't have any reason to load Google Fonts from
Google servers. Even [performance wise](https://wicki.io/posts/2020-11-goodbye-google-fonts/),
there is no reason to use Google CDNs.

To prevent any data being transmitted to a third party,
[download the fonts and host them with your project website](https://github.com/google/fonts#self-host-fonts-available-from-google-fonts).

### Can I embed Google Maps?

Yes, you can use Google Maps, but they should only activate if the user
actively wants to use them. Arrange this by showing a placeholder image first
and loading the map when the user clicks on the image. Make it clear
that users will load a Google Map with their click.

### Can I embed videos (from YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)?

Yes, you can embed videos on the website, but they should load
only after the user actively wants them to load. Arrange this 
by showing a placeholder image first and loading the video after the user
clicks on the image. Make it clear that users who click the image
will load a video from a third party.

If you don't want placeholder images, consider self-hosted videos
and using an open source player like [Plyr](https://github.com/sampotts/plyr).

### Can I embed social plugins (in example Like-Buttons)?

Yes, but you can only load them when users actively want them
to load. There are many open source solutions to help you manage this, like [Shariff](https://github.com/heiseonline/shariff).

### Can we have an official Facebook fan page?

No. 

You cannot run an official ASF Facebook page.

The German [Datenschutzkonferenz decided on 2019-04-01](https://www.datenschutzkonferenz-online.de/media/dskb/20190405_positionierung_facebook_fanpages.pdf) that you cannot fulfill [Art. 5 ยง2](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/). Also, having a fan page would not be compatible with Art. 26. 

### Can I add a Facebook/Twitter etc custom pixel for creating a custom audience?

No, not without approval from your user.
